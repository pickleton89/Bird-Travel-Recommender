```markdown
# Chickadee Hybrid Zone Analysis

## Current Contact Zone Status

## Recent eBird Data Analysis
- Pure BCCH: >40.5°N latitude (high confidence)
- Pure CACH: <39.5°N latitude (high confidence)
- Hybrid zone: 39.5-40.5°N (variable)

## Field Identification Challenges
- Vocal analysis most reliable
- "Fee-bee" vs "Fee-bee-ee" 
- Hybrid songs documented
- Genetic sampling needed for confirmation

## Research Opportunities
- Contact [University] hybrid zone project
- eBird special protocol available
- Breeding season focus critical
```

## Integration Examples

### Using Multiple Tools

**Query:**
```
"I found a rare bird! Hooded Warbler in Boston. What should I do?"
```

**Response:**
```markdown
# Rare Bird Protocol: Hooded Warbler in Boston

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Document the Sighting
📸 Photos/video if possible
📝 Detailed notes:
   - Time and exact location
   - Behavior and habitat
   - Field marks observed

### 2. Report the Sighting
🚨 **eBird**: Submit immediately with details
🚨 **Local Birding Groups**: Mass Birding Facebook
🚨 **Regional Alerts**: Post to regional listserv

## Verification Help
This is notable for Boston! Hooded Warblers are rare but possible 
in fall. Key field marks:
- Black hood on yellow face (males)
- White tail spots visible in flight
- Olive back, yellow underparts

## Ethical Considerations
- If on private property, get permission
- Don't share exact location until confirmed
- Observe from respectful distance
