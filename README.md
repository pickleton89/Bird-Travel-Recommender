## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Set up API keys**: 
   ```bash
   cp config/.env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys
   ```

### Standalone Usage (Without MCP)

The Bird Travel Recommender can be used as a standalone command-line application:

```bash
# Run the main application
uv run python main.py

# Or run as a module
uv run python -m bird_travel_recommender
```

#### Interactive Mode

When you run the application, you'll enter an interactive chat interface where you can:

- Ask about recent bird sightings in specific locations
- Request birding trip recommendations
- Get information about specific bird species
- Plan optimal birding routes

**Example queries:**
```
> What birds have been seen in Central Park this week?
> Plan a weekend birding trip to see warblers near San Francisco
> Is the Painted Bunting found in Texas?
> Find the best spots to see owls within 50 miles of Portland
```

#### Direct API Usage

You can also import and use the components directly in your Python code:

```python
from bird_travel_recommender.flow import create_birding_flow
from bird_travel_recommender.utils.ebird_api import EBirdClient

# Create a birding flow
flow = create_birding_flow()

# Use the flow to process queries
result = flow.run({
    "query": "Find recent sightings of rare birds near Austin, Texas",
    "location": "Austin, TX",
    "radius": 25
})

# Or use individual components
client = EBirdClient()
sightings = client.get_recent_observations("US-TX", days_back=7)
```

## 🤖 Claude Desktop MCP Integration

The Bird Travel Recommender can be integrated with Claude Desktop to provide birding tools directly in your Claude conversations.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Deploy the MCP server**:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/deploy_mcp.py development
   ```

2. **Copy the configuration to Claude Desktop**:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/mcp_config_development.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```
   
   Or manually edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` and add:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "bird-travel-recommender": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["run", "python", "scripts/mcp_server.py"],
         "cwd": "/path/to/Bird-Travel-Recommender",
         "env": {
           "PYTHONPATH": "src"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP server

4. **Verify the integration**: In Claude Desktop, you should now have access to 30 birding tools across 6 categories:
   - **Species Tools** (2) - Species validation and regional species lists
   - **Location Tools** (11) - Hotspot discovery, regional analysis, and geographic data
   - **Pipeline Tools** (11) - Data processing, temporal analysis, and filtering
   - **Planning Tools** (2) - Trip planning and itinerary generation
   - **Advisory Tools** (1) - Expert birding advice and recommendations
   - **Community Tools** (3) - Social features and birder statistics

### Usage Example

Once integrated, you can ask Claude Desktop questions like:
- "Find recent sightings of Painted Bunting near Austin, Texas"
- "Plan a 3-day birding trip to see warblers in Central Park"
- "What rare birds have been spotted in San Francisco this week?"

This project is built using [PocketFlow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow), a minimalist 100-line LLM framework created by Zachary Huang and The Pocket team. PocketFlow provides the core pipeline architecture that enables our node-based bird travel recommendation workflow system. PocketFlow is released under the MIT License and offers a lightweight, dependency-free approach to building AI agent workflows with support for multi-agent coordination and task decomposition.

This project's MCP tool architecture and eBird API integration patterns were significantly influenced by the [ebird-mcp-server](https://github.com/moonbirdai/ebird-mcp-server) by moonbirdai. Their working JavaScript implementation provided proven patterns for MCP tool schemas, eBird API endpoint strategies, and error handling approaches that we adapted for our Python-based PocketFlow architecture.

We also reference the [ebird-api](https://github.com/ProjectBabbler/ebird-api) Python wrapper by ProjectBabbler, distributed under the MIT License. While we implement our own custom eBird API utilities following the hybrid approach outlined in our design documentation, both projects provided valuable insights into best practices for eBird API integration.

Additional thanks to Eric Nost from the University of Guelph's Digital Conservation project for the comprehensive eBird API tutorial, which provided detailed implementation guidance and real-world usage patterns.
