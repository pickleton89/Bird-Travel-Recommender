    * Applied proper mocking at handler instance level: `mcp_server.handlers.location_handlers.ebird_api`
    * Updated tests to use proper MCP protocol with CallToolRequest objects and correct response structure validation
  - **Phase 1.3 Complete - Enhanced Error Handling Tests**: Fixed all 3 Enhanced Error Handling tests with parameter validation corrections
    * Corrected parameter names to match handler signatures: `species_names` for validate_species, `region` for get_regional_species_list
    * Updated test assertions to match actual error response structure using `error_category` field
    * Successfully fixed: `test_enhanced_species_validation`, `test_regional_species_error_handling`, `test_error_logging`
